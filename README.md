<h2 text-align=center>Yield On Cost Dividend Tool</h2>

<h3 text-align=left>Summary</h3>
<p>This is a simple tool that will forecast what a stock's dividend will be in X number of years. This is calculated by finding the average dividend increase and the average capital return over however many years you'd like to use. This is by no means financial advice, it is a tool that I wrote that can be used to plan for the future</p>
